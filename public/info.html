            Overview
        </h3>
        <p>
            Mafia is a social deduction game created by Dmitry Davidoff in 1986 modelling a
            conflict between two groups: an informed minority (the evils), and an uninformed majority (the villagers).
            At the start of the game, each player is secretly assigned a role affiliated with one of these teams. The
            game has two alternating phases: first, a night role, during which those with night killing powers may
            covertly kill other players, and second, a day role, in which surviving players debate the identities of
            players and vote to eliminate a suspect. The game continues until a faction achieves its win condition; for
            village, this usually means eliminating all evils, while for evils, this usually means reaching numerical
            equality with the village.
